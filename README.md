# Practical Lab 1 - Univariate Linear Regression on the California Housing Prices Dataset

This project performs univariate linear regression on the California Housing Prices dataset to predict median house value based on three features: median income, population, and number of households. The process includes:
Loading and exploring the dataset.
Creating scatter plots to visualize relationships.
Running three linear regression models, one for each feature.
Calculating model metrics: intercept, slope, MSE, MAE.
Plotting regression lines with metrics overlaid.
Comparing models to evaluate which feature best predicts housing prices.
The goal is to identify which independent variable has the strongest linear relationship with median house value.
